# Operating Systems Library

This is an ongoing project to develop an operating systems library. I am currently at the stage of coding the most famous OS algorithms.

## Currently Added OS Algorithms

### Disk Scheduler:
Disk scheduling algorithms used for I/O scheduling are implemented including:
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
- SCAN
- Circular SCAN (C-SCAN)
- LOOK
- Circular LOOK (C-LOOK)

### Memory Management
Memory management algorithms used for managing operations between main memory and disk are implemented including:
- First Fit
- Best Fit
- Worst Fit
